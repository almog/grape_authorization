## Grape authorization playground

A Rails-API application (based on [this tutorial](http://www.sitepoint.com/build-great-apis-grape/)) using grape that surrounds a single resource - Employee, whose  columns are: name and address age.

I created this app to test different authorization libraries such as [CanCan(Can)](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan), [Pundit](elabs/pundit) and [the_role](the-teacher/the_role).
